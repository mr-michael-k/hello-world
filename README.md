# hello-world
testing out the github site

Hello all who may read this in the future. My name is Michael A. Kornoelje Jr. I am a recent graduate of computer science with a focus in software development. I became a member of github to begin to increase my knowledge of programming by creating projects of my own and contributing to the projects of others. This is my first contribution thus far of what will be many more to come! Enjoy your day!
